Text Analysis Assigment One 
The text analysis that I chose is the values, community, open, collaboration,  openness graph (fig. 2) The Push and Pull of Digital Humanities: Topic Modeling the “What is digital humanities?” The data comes from 300 article length pieces from the bibliography of Defining Digital Humanities by Melissa Terras, Julietta Nyhan and Eduward Vanhoutte. The analysis that I am looking at is a line graph. The article does not go into detail about which tool that created the line graph but there are a few possibilities one is Voyant as it is a common tool for text analysis and it has the ability to create line graphs it also has word clouds earlier in the article which can also be created in voyant. Though it can also be but less likely to be made from a spreadsheet either from google sheets or excel.  
What the graph says about Digital Humanities more broadly according to this group is how much Digital Humanities is concerned with the idea of values, community, open collaboration, and openness between 2004-2016. What the graph reflects is that there was a large spike in 2012  but then rapidly decreased by 2014 and that overall from 2004-2016 digital humanities was not considered with ideas of openness.
