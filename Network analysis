I had a lot of trouble with this assigment. I started out with trying Gephi-Light but I could not get a file uploaded it. I started would with the Marvel data and though that might be the promblem so I switched to the GOT data since I had seen that it had worked but that still didn't work. I also tried changing between uploading between the nodes and edges to see if that would make a diffrence but it still didn't do anything. Finally I resorted to refressing the page and eventally restarted my computre but that still didnt' do anything. I also tried using the romate data set but that still didn't do anything 
I then switched to trying Palladio which I had better results. I was able to get the data uploaded and though it took me a while of poking around to figure out to get the network anaylsis and the matric but once I did figure it out I was able to play with the diffrent way the anaylsis looked and the way that get it downladed relativly quickly. Here is my visulazation: file:///C:/Users/ambar/OneDrive/Desktop/Palladio%20Graph.svg
Finally, Itried network navigator which was my favorit to use as it was the easist. I din't have any trouble uploading my data and once I got it open the network and the metric was right there without me having to go looking for it but I was still able to change the visulation easily.
