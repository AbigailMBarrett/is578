The type of visualization is a mix between a timeline and a map. The tool is one called Visual Eyes. What this tool refers to is to tell the visualization that it is helpful to show the data in more than one way. This tool has the ability to not only show the story as a timeline but also on a map of the succession of objects. I think what it says about DH trends to add more context to the data by not only through text but adding more visualization.

The tool is clear which editing software that they used but they used but it could be any one as they are just taking  clipping movies and putting them together which most editing software could use. What it tells us about DH visualization is that it can be more than graphs, maps and timeline but also utilizing video. It can also be a different way to display not only quantitative data but also qualitative. Also ways to show data that is visual and auditory in a way that can be better communicated. Also I am not sure what type of data visualization that this is supposed to be as it doesnâ€™t fit the stared way of thinking of data visualization even though there is data that is being made visual.
