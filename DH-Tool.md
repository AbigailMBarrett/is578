I consider Zotero to be a DH tool because it is a digital tool which can help researchers both in the humanities to organize resources (including digital sources), write notes, and create citations. Zotero is also referred to as a DH tool in articles such as "Building Better Digital Humanities Tools: Toward Broader Audiences and User-Centered Designs." I also choose Zotero because I have been using it for the past three years so it is the DH tool that I am most comfortable using.
