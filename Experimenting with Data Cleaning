Downloading Open Refine and navigating I found to be simple that is because I have used it befroe. 
I then changed the confrence date to an actual date though on the exel sheet is shows up as ######. 
I then used the text filter tool following the intrstuction linked which helped. I decided to use the text filter on the work_title as I decided that would be the easiest way of making sure the tool was mentioned. I first typed in YouTube as I rembered that someone mentioning Twitter as a DH tool and womendered if YouTube would also be included; it came up with four diffrent paper. Since that did not meet the requirments I broadened my search to social media which reveled 22 papers.
Then, I downloaded it as file as a .xls file and uploaded to github.
