For this assigment I looked at the "The Valley of Shadow" database which hold materials from the University of Viringa about the United States Before After and During the Civil War. https://valley.lib.virginia.edu/VoS/choosepart.html 
As far as I could tell the site was constructed using html and cvs from the files that I could see and looked at.
I would not consider this project to be minimal computing. Though the site of programing seem simple (though I don't know basically anything about code I have determined this because I can undertand the code on the screen) nothing else of this project is minimal computing. It is a digital database of first hand sources not only before, during, and after the civil war which includes a lot of data. Another point is that minimal community in digital humanities can be done by anyone the examples given and those who adopt it are those who work in the global south and those who donâ€™t have the experience, stable internet, or money. This project was created by the University of Virginia which does not have a lack of resources. The last point that this project was not made by minimal computing is the fact that there is a new website https://valley.newamericanhistory.org/ with the the same resources on it. The fact that there are two working websites wiht the same information is just kind of unnessarry and so not in the spirit of minimal computing.
